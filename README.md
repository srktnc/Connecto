## Connecto

Connecto is a customizable C# library for managing HTTP requests, inspired by the popular AxiosJS library. It provides a powerful tool for developers working with C# and Unity, allowing them to easily manage HTTP requests and customize the library to meet their project's needs.

## Features

*   `Request` class for sending HTTP requests with customizable properties and methods.
*   `Interceptor` class for performing pre- and post-request operations.
*   `Response` class for easier processing of response data.
*   `BatchRequest` class for sending multiple requests at once.
*   `Timeout` class for limiting the time allowed for requests to complete.
*   Additional features such as request cancellation and multiple request sending functionality.

## Usage

Connecto can be used in open-source projects and is designed to be customizable and extensible to meet the needs of various projects. To use Connecto in your project, simply include the library in your project's dependencies and import the necessary classes.

```plaintext
using Connecto;

// Create a new request
Request request = new Request("https://example.com");

// Add parameters and headers to the request
request.AddParam("key", "value");
request.AddHeader("Authorization", "Bearer token");

// Send the request
Response response = await request.SendAsync();
```
Please note that the usage instructions may change as Connecto is further developed. We appreciate your patience and feedback as we continue to improve the library.
